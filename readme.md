Instructions for setup:
1. Activate the Cloud Shell:
    a. Open the Cloud Console in your GCP project.
    b. Click on the Cloud Shell icon on the top right.
2. Clone your code repository:
    If your scripts are stored in a Git repository, clone it inside the Cloud Shell: <git clone> <REPO_URL>
3. Install necessary Python packages in your Cloud Composer environment:
    Install any additional libraries using <pip install> in your Cloud Composer environment.
4. Upload your scripts to the dags folder in the Cloud Composer environment's bucket:
    First, find the bucket associated with your Cloud Composer environment using the GCP Console or using the command:
    sql
    <gcloud composer environments describe ENVIRONMENT_NAME --location LOCATION>
    Use gsutil to copy the scripts:
    bash:
    <gsutil cp -r /path/to/your/scripts gs://YOUR_BUCKET/dags/>
5. Access the Airflow web UI:
    In the GCP Console, navigate to Cloud Composer.
    Click on the name of your environment.
    Click on the Airflow web UI link.
6. Trigger your DAG:
    In the Airflow web UI, find the DAG with the ID numerai_elt.
    Trigger it manually for the first time.

Following these steps, your ELT workflow will be orchestrated with Apache Airflow in Cloud Composer. Remember to monitor and set up alerts for your DAG to be informed of any issues or failures.
